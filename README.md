## Overview

The **Moodl** is a web-based application built using **React** and **Next.js** for the front-end and **Firebase** for authentication and database, and **Vercel** for hosting. This app allows users to track their mood over time by recording how they feel throughout the day. The recorded moods can be visualized over a calendar and in charts to help users better understand their emotional patterns.
